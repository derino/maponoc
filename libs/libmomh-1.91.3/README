Thanks to its license, we are distributing a slightly modified version of
MOMHLib++ within maponoc. Some fixes to get it working with newer gcc
versions and some bug fixes are done.

===== Original README is below ==============================================

MOMHLib++ (Multiple Objective MetaHeuristics Library in C++) is a library 
of C++ classes that implements a number of multiple objective metaheuristics. 
It has been developed on the basis of former implementations of Pareto 
simulated annealing (PSA) and multiple objective genetic local search (MOGLS).
The goals of development of the library may be summarized as follows:

-	to implement the main multiple objective metaheuristics in a 
	consistent way
-	to allow easy adaptation of the methods to a given problem
-	to support evaluation of multiple objective metaheuristics on a given 
	problem
-	to allow easy incorporation of new multiple objective metaheuristics 
	and to support the development of new methods

At present the library includes the following methods:

-	Pareto simulated annealing (PSA) 
	[http://www-idss.cs.put.poznan.pl/~jaszkiewicz/psa/index.html]
-	Serafini's multiple objective simulated annealing (SMOSA)[4][5]
-	Ulungu's et al. multiple objective simulated annealing (MOSA) [7]
-	Pareto memetic algorithm [8]
-	multiple objective genetic local search (MOGLS) MOGLS
	[http://www-idss.cs.put.poznan.pl/~jaszkiewicz/mogls/index.html]
-	Ishibuchi's and Murata's multiple objective genetic local search 
	(IMMOGLS) [3]
-	multiple objective multiple start local search (MOMSLS)
-	non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) [6] and controlled 
	NSGA II [1]
-	Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm [9]

Each method is implemented in a separate template class that utilizes a number 
of common library classes. The template classes are instantiated with classes 
corresponding to solutions of a given problem.

In order to adapt one or more of the multiple objective metaheuristics to 
a given problem one has to implement a new class corresponding to the problem's
solution by deriving from the library class TMOMHSolution. A detailed design 
pattern described in the documentation of MOMHLib++ illustrates the suggested 
way of adapting the library to a given problem.

The library is implemented in standard C++. It uses standard template 
library - STL. Thus, it may be compiled under any standard C++ compiler.
